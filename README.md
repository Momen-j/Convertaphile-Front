## ðŸ”— How It Works

Convertaphile's backend functions as a microservice:

1. Users send a `POST` request with a file and desired output format to the `/conversion` endpoint.
2. The server saves the uploaded file to a secure, temporary location.
3. The file is analyzed to determine its exact type and characteristics.
4. Based on the detected type and requested output, FFmpeg is invoked with specific, optimized commands to perform the conversion.
5. The converted file is streamed back to the user with appropriate HTTP headers (e.g., `Content-Disposition` for download).
6. All temporary files are immediately deleted from the server.

This ensures privacy, efficiency, and a clean server environment.
